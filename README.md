# Acknowledgements

- GPT4 for keenly speculating on the combination of these algorithms in response to the latest OpenAI craze
- GPT4 for basically writing these relatively unassisted in essentially an inefficient loop of copy-pasting ranging 15min - 2hrs depending on interpretation (ain't right.  code wasn't meant to be churned out this effortlessly. we're supposed to *bleed* for it)
- OpenAI for kindly not implementing a seamless interface to extract and update code in a refactoring loop straight from chat window, thus preserving my job.
(And also not showing me how to properly integrate it into my IDE with latest tooling, which I'm sure exists)
- [Eureka Team](https://github.com/eureka-research/Eureka) for making it evidently clear how simple this stuff can be (ITS A LOOP), how close we are to the edge, and how plausibly one small tweak in architecture setup might be enough for the next breakthrough.
- [Voyager](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager/blob/main/skill_library/README.md), [Jarvis-1](https://github.com/CraftJarvis/JARVIS-1), and [PokemonRedExperiments](https://github.com/PWhiddy/PokemonRedExperiments) for pushing development where it's truly needed
- [Lara Croft Tomb Raider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wTf_bbkW2U&ab_channel=FoxMaster) for making me *believe*

# Future Directions

- Comparing this to a million similar small deviations of MCST-like loops to see what makes Q so special (if anything)
- Implementing this graph pathfinding on a dataset of recipes derived from the incredibly solid game [Another Farm Roguelike](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116850/Another_Farm_Roguelike/) which is just itching to be solved by ML (thus proving out the power of recipes for all time)
